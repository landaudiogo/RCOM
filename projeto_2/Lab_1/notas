tux54 -> 172.16.50.254/24
tux53 -> 172.16.50.1/24

1. Connect the serial port of tux54 to the switch console
2. in gkterm: >show vlan
    - check whether all ports are connected to the same vlan (in this lab should be vlan 1 (default))
    - in case their not, resetting the switch might be necessary
        >enable                                     # password "8nortel"
        >no vlan 2-4094                             # remove vlans between 2-4094 (virtual local networks)
        >exit                                       # exit the environment you entered with enable
        >copy flash:tux5clean startup-config        
        >reload                                     # reset the switch
3. Connect tux53 and tux54 to any ports in the switch
4. in tux53 terminal:
    >ifconfig eth0 172.16.50.1/24                # configure the local PC (tux53) to the specified IP address
5. in tux54 terminal:
    >ifconfig eth0 172.16.50.254/24              # configure the local PC (tux54) to the specified IP address
6. Send the ping to the other computer's address. The next steps are assuming that you are on tux53
    >ping 172.16.50.254                          # The pinged computer should be reachable
7. Still on computer tux53, run the following commands:
    >arp -n                        # will show that IP 172.16.50.254 corresponds to a $mac_address (48 bits/6 bytes)
    >arp -d 172.16.50.254          # will remove the entry related to 172.16.50.254
    # START A WIRESHARK CAPTURE
    >ping 172.16.50.254
